Logical Explanation of The Program "All 7 Combined" - Canaon

This Java program is a menu-driven application that allows the user to perform various operations on different types of data structures. 
The user can choose from a set of options, each corresponding to a specific data structure, and the program will then perform operations 
related to that data structure.

1. Menu-driven Interface:
- The program starts with a menu that presents the user with options to choose a data structure or exit the program.
- The user is prompted to enter their choice.

2. Switch Statement:
- The program uses a switch statement to determine the action based on the user's choice.
- Each case corresponds to a specific data structure, and the associated method for performing operations on that data structure is called.

3. Data Structure Operations:
- For each data structure (List, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Binary Tree, Graph), there is a separate method to perform operations.
- The operations are simple examples demonstrating how to create and manipulate instances of each data structure.

4. List Operations:
- Creates a simple ArrayList and adds elements to it.

5. Linked List Operations:
- Creates a simple LinkedList and adds elements to it.

6. Stack Operations:
- Creates a simple Stack and pushes elements onto it.

7. Queue Operations:
- Creates a simple Queue (implemented using LinkedList) and offers elements to it.

8. Tree Operations:
- Creates a simple tree structure using a custom TreeNode class and prints the elements of the created tree in an inorder traversal.

9. Binary Tree Operations:
- Creates a simple binary tree structure using a custom BinaryTreeNode class and prints the elements of the created binary tree in an inorder traversal.

10. Graph Operations:
- Creates a simple graph represented as an adjacency list.

11. Exiting the Program:
- If the user chooses to exit (option 8), the program prints a message and terminates.

12. Classes:
- The program defines two static nested classes, TreeNode and BinaryTreeNode, to represent nodes in tree and binary tree structures.

13. Loop:
- The program runs in an infinite loop (while (true)) until the user chooses to exit.

14. User Input:
- User input is obtained using a Scanner object.
 
It provides a basic understanding of how to work with different data structures in Java.
