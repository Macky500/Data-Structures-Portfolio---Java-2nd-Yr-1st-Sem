Logical Explanation of the Program "Graph" - Canaon

This Java program defines a simple implementation of an undirected graph using an adjacency list representation and performs basic operations on the graph.

1. Graph Class:
- The Graph class represents an undirected graph using an adjacency list.
- It has a private member adjacencyList, which is a Map<Integer, List<Integer>> where each vertex is associated with a list of its neighbors.
- The constructor initializes an empty graph by creating an empty HashMap.
- The addVertex method adds a vertex to the graph by creating a new entry in the adjacency list with an empty list of neighbors.
- The addEdge method adds an undirected edge between two vertices. It does so by adding each vertex to the other's list of neighbors.
- The displayGraph method iterates through the adjacency list and prints each edge in the format "vertex - neighbor."

2. GraphOperations Class:
- The GraphOperations class contains the main method, which serves as the entry point of the program.
- An instance of the Graph class is created.
- Vertices (1 to 6) are added to the graph using the addVertex method.
- Edges are added between vertices using the addEdge method.
- The resulting graph is displayed using displayGraph and it is called to print the graph's edges.

3. Execution Flow:
- An instance of the Graph class, named graph, is created.
- Vertices (1 to 6) are added to the graph.
- Edges are added to create connections between vertices.
- The displayGraph method is called to print the graph.
- The program outputs the edges of the graph to the console.

Vertices: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Edges: (1,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,4), (2,5), (4,6), (5,6)

The displayGraph method prints the edges of the graph. The Output will be:

Graph:
1 - 2
1 - 3
2 - 1
2 - 4
2 - 5
3 - 1
3 - 4
4 - 2
4 - 3
4 - 6
5 - 2
5 - 6
6 - 4
6 - 5

The output shows the edges between vertices, indicating the connections in the undirected graph.
This program is a basic demonstration of graph representation and manipulation using an adjacency list.
