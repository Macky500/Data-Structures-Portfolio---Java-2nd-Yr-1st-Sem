Logical Explanation of The Program "Binary Tree" - Canaon

This Java program implements a simple binary search tree (BST) and provides basic operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and inorder traversal.

1. Node Class:
- The Node class represents a node in the binary tree. 
- Each node has an integer key, a reference to the left child (left), and a reference to the right child (right).

2. BinaryTree Class:
- The BinaryTree class is responsible for managing the binary tree. 
- It has a private instance variable root representing the root of the tree.

3. Insertion Operation:
- The insert method inserts a new key into the binary tree. 
- It is a recursive method that compares the key with the current node's key and traverses either the left or right subtree accordingly until an appropriate 
position for insertion is found.

4. Deletion Operation:
- The delete method removes a key from the binary tree. 
- It handles three cases:
1. Node with no child: Simply removes the node.
2. Node with one child: Removes the node and connects its parent to its only child.
3. Node with two children: Finds the inorder successor (smallest key in the right subtree), replaces the node's key with the successor's key, and then 
recursively deletes the successor.

5. Searching Operation:
- The search method checks whether a key exists in the binary tree. 
- It is a recursive method that compares the key with the current node's key and traverses either the left or right subtree accordingly.

6. Inorder Traversal Operation:
- The inorderTraversal method performs an inorder traversal of the binary tree, printing the keys in ascending order (Left-Root-Right).

7. Main Method:
- The main method provides a simple user interface using a Scanner for interacting with the binary tree. 
- It allows the user to:
1. Insert a value into the tree.
2. Delete a value from the tree.
3. Search for a value in the tree.
4. Display the inorder traversal of the tree.
5. Exit the program.

8. User Interaction:
- The program uses a menu-driven approach where the user can input choices (1 to 5) to perform various operations. The loop continues until the user chooses to exit (option 5).

9. Closing Scanner:
- The Scanner is properly closed using the scanner.close() method to prevent resource leaks.

The program provides a basic implementation of a binary search tree with user interaction for testing various operations on the tree.
