Logical Explanation of the Program "Queue" - Canaon

- This Java program defines a class NumberedQueue that represents a circular queue of integers with a specified maximum size. 
- The program provides methods to perform various operations on the queue, such as inserting an element at the rear, removing an element from the front, 
shifting elements to the right, and traversing/printing the elements. 
- The main method serves as a user interface to interact with the queue through a console menu.

Key Components of The Program

1. Class Definition (NumberedQueue) Class:
- The class has private variables to represent the maximum size of the queue, an array to store queue elements, front and rear pointers, and the current 
size of the queue.

Fields:
- maxSize: Maximum size of the queue.
- queueArray: An array to store the elements of the queue.
- front: Index of the front element.
- rear: Index of the rear element.
- size: Current number of elements in the queue.

2. Constructor:
- Initializes the queue with a specified size.
- Sets front to 0, rear to -1, and size to 0.

3. Methods:
- isFull(): Checks if the queue is full. Returns true if the queue is full, false otherwise.
- isEmpty(): Checks if the queue is empty. Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
- insertAtRear(int data): Inserts an element at the rear of the queue.
- removeElement(): Removes an element from the front of the queue.
- shiftElements(): Shifts all elements one position to the right.
- traverseAndPrint(): Traverses the queue and prints its elements.

Main Method:
1. User Input:
- Creates a scanner for user input.
- Asks the user to input the size of the queue and takes it as input.
- Creates a NumberedQueue object with the specified size.

2. Menu-driven Loop:
- Displays a menu of options to the user indefinitely using a while (true) loop.
- Options include inserting an element, removing an element, shifting elements, traversing and printing, and exiting the program.

3. Switch Case:
- Uses a switch-case statement to perform the selected operation based on the user's input.
- Takes user input to choose an option.
- Depending on the chosen option, it calls the corresponding method of the NumberedQueue class.
- If the user chooses to exit, the program terminates.

4. Operations:
- Insert at Rear (Option 1): Takes a number as input and inserts it at the rear of the queue.
- Remove Element (Option 2): Removes an element from the front of the queue.
- Shift Elements (Option 3): Shifts all elements one position to the right.
- Traverse and Print (Option 4): Prints the elements of the queue.
- Exit (Option 5): Exits the program.

5. User Interaction:
- For each option, the program interacts with the user through the console, asking for input or displaying the result of the chosen operation.

6. Flow Control:
- The program runs in an infinite loop until the user chooses to exit.
- The loop ensures that the user can perform multiple operations on the queue without restarting the program.

7. Exiting the Program:
- If the user chooses to exit, the program prints a goodbye message and terminates using System.exit(0).

8. Error Handling:
- The program includes a default case in the switch statement to handle invalid user input.
- Handles invalid input gracefully and prompts the user to try again.

Overall:
- The program provides a simple interactive interface for users to manipulate a circular queue of numbers with various operations. 
- The queue uses modular arithmetic to achieve circular behavior. 
- The program runs until the user chooses to exit.
