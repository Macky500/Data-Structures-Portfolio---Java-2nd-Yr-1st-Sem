Logical Explanation of the Program "Tree" - Canaon

This Java program defines two classes, TreeNode and Tree, to represent a basic tree structure and includes a main method to demonstrate the creation 
and printing of a tree.

1. TreeNode Class:
- "TreeNode" represents a node in the tree.
- It has an integer data field (int data) to store the node's value.
- It has a List<TreeNode> children to store a list of child nodes.
The constructor initializes the data field and initializes the list of children as an empty ArrayList.
- The addChild method adds a child node to the list of children.
- The getChildren method returns the list of children.

2. Tree Class:
- "Tree" represents the entire tree and has a reference to the root node.
- The constructor initializes the root as null.
- The setRoot method sets the root of the tree.
- The printTree method recursively prints the tree structure starting from a given node.
- The main method is the entry point of the program.
- It creates a Tree object.
- It creates several TreeNode objects to build a basic tree structure.
- It establishes the relationships between nodes using the addChild method.
- It sets the root of the tree using the setRoot method.
- It prints the tree structure using the printTree method.

3. Main Method Execution:
- An instance of the Tree class is created.
- Several nodes are created and linked together to form a tree structure.
- The root of the tree is set using the setRoot method.
- The tree structure is printed using the printTree method, starting from the root.

Output:

Tree structure:
1 -> [ 2 3 ]
2 -> [ 4 5 ]
4 -> [ ]
5 -> [ ]
3 -> [ ]

- The output shows the tree structure, where each line represents a node and its children. 
- In this case, node 1 has children 2 and 3, node 2 has children 4 and 5, and nodes 4, 5, and 3 have no children.


Breaking it step by step, we have:

1. Defining the TreeNode Class:
- The TreeNode class represents a node in the tree. Each node has an integer data value and a list of children nodes.
- The addChild method adds a child node to the list of children, and the getChildren method returns the list of children.

2. Defining the Tree Class:
- The Tree class has a root attribute representing the root node of the tree.
- The setRoot method allows setting the root of the tree.
- The printTree method is a recursive function that prints the structure of the tree. It starts from a given node, prints its data, and then recursively 
prints the structure of each child.

3. Creating a Tree Object:
- In the main method, a new Tree object called tree is created.

4. Creating the Tree Nodes:
- Several TreeNode objects are created with integer data values: rootNode (1), child1 (2), child2 (3), child3 (4), and child4 (5).

5. Building the Tree:
- Nodes are connected to form a tree structure. rootNode is set as the root, and children are added to their respective parent nodes using the addChild method.

The tree structure looks like this:

1 -> [ 2 3 ]
2 -> [ 4 5 ]

6. Setting the Tree Root:
- The root of the tree object is set using the setRoot method, with rootNode as the argument.

7. Printing the Tree:
- The program then prints the structure of the tree using the printTree method starting from the root.

The output will be:

Tree structure:
1 -> [ 2 3 ]
2 -> [ 4 5 ]
4 -> [ ]
5 -> [ ]
3 -> [ ]

- The output represents the hierarchical structure of the tree, indicating the parent-child relationships. 
- The indentation reflects the level of nesting in the tree. In this case, nodes 4 and 5 are children of node 2, and node 2 is a child of node 1.
