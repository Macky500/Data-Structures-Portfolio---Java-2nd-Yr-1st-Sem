Logical Explanation of The Program "List" - Canaon

This Java program implements a simple interactive console-based application for managing a list of numbers. 

1. Import Statements:
- The program imports necessary classes from the java.util package, such as ArrayList, List and Scanner, to handle lists and user input.
  ArrayList and List are used for creating and manipulating lists, and Scanner is used to take input from the user.

2. Class Declaration:
The NumberList class is declared, and the main method is the entry point of the program.

3. Variable Initialization:
- An ArrayList named myList is created to store numbers as strings.
- A Scanner object named scanner is created to read user input.

4. Menu and Infinite Loop:
- The program runs in an infinite loop (while (true)) to keep the menu active until the user chooses to exit.

5. Menu Display:
- The program displays a menu with seven options:
1. Add a Number
2. Update a Number
3. Search for a Number
4. Remove a Number
5. Access a Number
6. Check if a Number is Present
7. Exit

6. User Input:
- The program prompts the user to enter a choice by displaying the menu and reading an integer from the user.

7. Switch Case:
- The program uses a switch statement to execute code based on the user's choice.

8. Menu Options:
1. Add a Number - Prompts the user to enter a number, adds it to the list, and confirms the addition.
2. Update a Number - Prompts the user for the index to update, checks if it's valid, updates the value, and confirms the update.
3. Search for a Number - Prompts the user to enter a number, searches for its index and last index in the list, and displays the results.
4. Remove a Number - Prompts the user for the index to remove, checks if it's valid, removes the number, and confirms the removal.
5. Access a Number - Prompts the user for the index to access, checks if it's valid, retrieves and displays the number.
6. Check if a Number is Present - Prompts the user to enter a number, checks if it's present in the list, and displays the result.
7. Exit the Program - Prints an exit message and terminates the program.
8. Default - Handles invalid menu choices and prompts the user to enter a valid option.

The program continues to loop until the user chooses to exit (option 7), at which point the program terminates. 
It provides basic functionality to manipulate a list of numbers through user input.
